Progress: 
First, created the ERC-20 token contract. Then, I wrote unit tests in Hardhat so that the contract functions as expected and handles errors if any properly. After identifying a bug where users could burn locked tokens, I debugged the contract code and fixed it to prevent the issue. Finally, I documented the debugging steps and solution for clarity.

Challenges Encountered: One challenge I faced was ensuring the unit tests covered everything around the contract functionalities, especially error scenarios and around the DApp Conceptualization.  

Insights Gained: Through these assignments, I gained a deeper understanding of Solidity and smart contract testing using tools like Hardhat.
